# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end developer in development. In other words, I've become passionate about learning programming and design.
I intend to share, here on this page, the most important parts of my learning, research, and projects. With this, I hope to be able to contribute to this very active and supportive community.</br>
Thanks for visiting me!
