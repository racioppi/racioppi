# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end developer in development, aiming to become a full-stack developer.
I've become passionate about learning programming and design, and I am always looking for new challenges to grow.

On this page, I intend to share the most important parts of my learning, research, and projects. With this, I hope to contribute to this very active and supportive community.  
Thanks for visiting me! ðŸ˜Š
